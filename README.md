## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a junior web developer with a background in programming and experience in Full-Stack projects. I recently completed an Associate's Degree in Programming at the National Technological University (Rosario, Argentina), with the diploma currently in process.

I stand out for my commitment, responsibility, and enthusiasm for learning and growing in collaborative work environments. I have a strong command of English, acquired through self-study, which allows me to work comfortably with technical documentation and professional communication.

I'm looking for opportunities as a **web developer** (frontend, backend, or full-stack) in dynamic environments where I can continue developing my skills and contribute value to the team's projects.
